        <p class="text-2xl">We love to help our clients show off. One of them was hosting a big event for their clients in Arizona. The weather was beautiful, especially at night, and part of the event included a cocktail party by the pool. Our client was looking for a unique way to represent their clients and add a cool, fun element to the décor. <br/><br/> We found an inspiration photo of some light up cubes that could be used as a side table, ottoman or even a small seat, and got to work. </p>

        <p class="text-2xl">A similar style cube was available through one of our promotional vendors, but they were smaller than what the client had envisioned, and they were typically imprinted in batches that all had the same logo. Since there were fourteen clients to represent, that wouldn’t cut it. </p>

        <p class="text-2xl">We sourced larger, blank cubes through an online retailer and sent them to one of our local decoration partners to add the logos. After some trial, error, and trips to the decoration studio to inspect them in person, we decided on custom cut vinyl decals for each cube. </p>

          <br/><br/>Our client, and their clients, were thrilled with the result. They used the cubes for the pool party as planned, then brought them inside and incorporated them into the rest of the week’s events.  </p>
