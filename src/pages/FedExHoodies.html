            FedEx station 152 in Pittsburgh experienced an especially challenging week. They were already busier than ever and now a heavy snowstorm was about to hit.<br><br>
            A dedicated group of employees came to the rescue, worked overtime (on the weekend!) amid the blizzard, and got the job done.</p>

        <p class="text-2xl">Clearly this dream team needed some recognition, but a typical award just wasn’t their style. After asking some “get to know them” questions about the employees, we developed multiple designs for a custom printed hoodie. We wanted to capture the dynamic personalities of the team, the city they represent, and give them something they would actually use.</p>

      <div class="p-4">
        <p class="text-2xl">We sourced a moderately priced, high quality hoodie and had them printed with the winning design chosen by the team’s manager. Each one was then personalized with the recipient’s name on the back. <br><br>
            The result was a cool, comfy and thoughtful gift that made the team feel appreciated – while keeping them warm and promoting their brand, too.</p>
