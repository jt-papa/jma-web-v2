        <p class="text-2xl">Our client came to us with a tough question. How can we capture the excitement of graduation, inspire collaborative teamwork and motivate future leaders…from home? <br/><br/>
            CVS Health launched their leadership development program in person, but by graduation time we were in the thick of Covid-19 and remote meetings.

    <p class="text-2xl pb-20 mx-28">After sharing the itinerary and overall theme of the online event, we immediately started searching for ideas and realized one gift could never be enough - it had to be a kit! We presented the program leads at CVS with a selection of new, unique product ideas and narrowed them down together. We ordered the items, had them shipped to our fulfillment center, hand packed each box, and shipped them out to 130 individual recipients.</p>

    <div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-20 mx-28 pb-20">
        <p class="text-2xl">
            Each gift box included items strategically chosen for interactive use during the event: A pack of resistance bands and an essential oil diffuser, a Rocketbook reusable journal, Reinberger Nut Butter for a healthy snack (made in their headquarters’ state of Rhode Island), blue light blocker glasses, a flower planting kit as a nod to continued growth, DEVELOP – the book written by their keynote speaker Ted Fleming, and a printed card with a message from leadership, which included two custom printed cookies.<br/><br/>
            We also added a personal touch to two of the items: a mini light up marquee board pre-loaded with a custom message “Lead with Heart” and a picture frame, pre-loaded with photos of each recipient with their teammates.<br/><br/>

    </div>
      <p class="text-2xl pb-20 mx-28">The result wasn’t just a box of gifts, it was an experience. Unboxing and using the items made the teams feel like they were together even though they couldn’t be with each other in person. Best of all, this extraordinary group of future leaders felt loved and supported as they moved to the next phase of their careers.</p>
